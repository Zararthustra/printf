.SH NAME
_printf - formatted output conversion
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B #include \^"holberton.h\^"

.B int _printf(const char *\fIformat\fP, ...);

.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
Holberton project. Coding the (almost) same function as the original printf function.
.SS Return value
.PP
If success, returns the number of characters printed (excluding the null byte), or -1 if error.
.SS Format
.PP
The format string is composed of zero or more arguments which are converted. Each conversion specification is introduced by the character %, and ends with a conversion specifier.
.SS The conversion specifier
A character that specifies the type of conversion to be applied. The conversion specifiers and their meanings are:
.TP
.B
d, i 
The \fIint\fP argument is converted to signed decimal notation.
.TP
.B
o, u, x, X
The \fIunsigned int\fP is converted to unsigned octal (\fBo\fP), unsigned decimal (\fBu\fP), or unsigned hexadecimal (\fBx\fP and \fBX\fP) notation. The letters \fBabcdef\fP are used for \fBx\fP conversions; the letters \fBABCDEF\fP are used for \fBX\fP conversion.
.TP
.B
c
The \fIint\fP argument is converted to an \fIunsigned char\fP, and the resulting character is written.
.TP
.B
s
The  \fIconst char *\fP argument is expected to be a pointer to an array of character type (pointer to a string).  Characters from the array  are written up to (but not including) a terminating null byte ('\0').
.TP
.B
S
Similar to \fBs\fP, prints the non printable characters (0 < ASCII value < 32 or >= 127) are printed this way: \\x, followed by the ASCII code value in hexadecimal.
.TP
.B
p
The \fIvoid *\fP pointer argument is printed in hexadecimal.
.TP
.B
b
The \fIunsigned int\fP argument is converted to binary.
.TP
.B
r
Similar to \fBs\fP, the string is printed in reverse.
.TP
.B
R
Similar to \fBs\fP, the string is converted into ROT13.
.TP
.B
%
A '%' is written.  No argument is converted. The complete conversion specification is '%%'.
.SH BUGS
.TP
No bugs.
.SH EXAMPLE
.PP
.TP
To print :
.TP
Hello, welcome to \fIHolberton School\fP. We are from the \fIC 13\fP cohort and we hope getting \fI200%\fP for the printf project !
.TP
#include "holberton.h"
_printf("Hello, welcome to %s. We are from the cohort %c%d and we hope getting 200%% for the printf project !", "Holberton", 'C', 13);
